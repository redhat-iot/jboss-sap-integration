JBoss A-MQ, BRMS, SQLAnywhere, HANA IoT Demo 
=====================================================================

Demo based on Red Hat JBoss A-MQ product, BRMS, SQLAnywhere and HANA. This demo uses simulated retail customer beacon data generated by a python script. 

Setup and Configuration
-----------------------

- Download JBoss A-MQ product from RED HAT (version 6.2) into install folder

- run 'init.sh' 

- start JBoss A-MQ

   go to ./target/jboss-a-mq-{$version}/bin
   execute JBoss A-MQ by executing ./amq

- Generate fake customer data by either running generatefakedata.py *or* use the included customers.dat.example file by renaming it to customer.dat. Copy the customer.dat file into the custsim directory.

- Run the custsim.py sript

  The custsim.py script is a Python script that will generate simulated customer actions 
  related to a retail store (entering, moving and exiting).
  To execute this script you will need Python installed and can exexute the script using 
  the command "python custsim.py" from the custsim folder. 
  
  Installing Python:

   OSx: https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ 
   Linux: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/    
   Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

- Download [SQL Anywhere 17 Developer Edition](https://www.sap.com/cmp/syb/crm-xm15-dwn-dt015/index.html) and install. You may need to [source the binaries](http://dcx.sap.com/index.html#sqla170/en/html/8135b1bb6ce2101499f0f55a54bc1ab2.html) before using.

- Rename persistance/remote.cfg.example to persistance/remote.cfg and set the correct host and port for fuse

- Create and populate the remote databaes. These commands will create the database, start it as a daemon listening on port 8080, and populate it with the fake customer data.

  - dbinit -dba dba,sqlsql remote.db
  - dbsrv17 -ud -xs http{port=8080} remote.db
  - dbisql -c "uid=dba;pwd=sqlsql" remote.sql

The global_database_id must be unique for each databaes that is created. If you need to create multiple databases, choose a new global_database_id each time.

  - dbisql -c "uid=dba;pwd=sqlsql" "SET OPTION PUBLIC.global_database_id = XX"

- Initially, the remote database does not have any data in it. To get the initial data you must peform a sync. Run:

  - ./sync.sh

- From now on, run the sync script any time you want to upload new data

- Build and install the BRMS rules engine.

- Install and run the HTML5 web UI to view customer activity in the store.
  - In the gui/customer-tracker project, run "mvn clean install" from the command line to build the war.
  - Deploy to a local JBoss EAP server.
  - Install node.js and run "node subscribe.js" from jboss-sap-integration/iot-demo/gui/customer-tracker/src/main/webapp/js. 
  - The web application will be available at http://localhost:8080/customer-tracker/
  - Customers will display and move around the store using the coordinates provided by messages from A-MQ. BRMS will detect customers that may need assistance due to focused attention to a single department or excessive browsing and send messages to alert salespersons.
