JBoss Data Virtualization, A-MQ, BRMS, SQLAnywhere, HANA IoT Demo 
=====================================================================

Demo based on Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization, A-MQ, BRMS, SQLAnywhere and HANA. This demo uses simulated retail customer beacon data generated by a python script.

Prerequisites
-----------------------

Install Python
-  OSx: https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ 
-  Linux: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/    
-  Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Install mqtt Python client
- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1

Install node.js
- https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

Install socket.io (node.js)
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io

Install mqtt (node.js)
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt

Install Maven
- https://maven.apache.org/install.html

Setup and Configuration
-----------------------

- Download JBoss A-MQ product from https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq (version 6.2) into install folder

- run 'init.sh' 

- start JBoss A-MQ

   go to ./target/jboss-a-mq-{$version}/bin
   execute JBoss A-MQ by executing ./amq

- Run the custsim.py sript

  The custsim.py script is a Python script that will generate simulated customer actions 
  related to a retail store (entering, moving and exiting).
  To execute this script you will need Python installed and can exexute the script using 
  the command "python custsim.py" from the custsim folder. 

- Download [SQL Anywhere 17 Developer Edition](https://www.sap.com/cmp/syb/crm-xm15-dwn-dt015/index.html) and install. You may need to [source the binaries](http://dcx.sap.com/index.html#sqla170/en/html/8135b1bb6ce2101499f0f55a54bc1ab2.html) before using.

- Rename persistance/remote.cfg.example to persistance/remote.cfg and set the correct host and port for fuse

- Create and populate the remote databaes. These commands will create the database, start it as a daemon listening on port 8080, and populate it with the fake customer data.

  - dbinit -dba dba,sqlsql remote.db
  - dbsrv17 -ud -xs http{port=8080} remote.db
  - dbisql -c "uid=dba;pwd=sqlsql" remote.sql

The global_database_id must be unique for each databaes that is created. If you need to create multiple databases, choose a new global_database_id each time.

  - dbisql -c "uid=dba;pwd=sqlsql" "SET OPTION PUBLIC.global_database_id = XX"

- Update your HANA DB using the DDL in the /persistance folder

- From the redhatsapiot directory, run java -jar target/redhatsapdemo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-uberjar.jar 

- Install and run the HTML5 web UI to view customer activity in the store.
  - In the gui/customer-tracker project, run "mvn clean install jetty:run" from the command line to build the war.
  - Run "node subscribe.js" from jboss-sap-integration/iot-demo-jdv/gui/customer-tracker/src/main/webapp/js. 
  - The web application will be available at http://localhost:8080/customer-tracker/
  - Customers will display and move around the store using the coordinates provided by messages from A-MQ. BRMS will detect customers that may need assistance due to focused attention to a single department or excessive browsing and send messages to alert salespersons.

  - Model your sources in Teiid Designer
  -   HANA import
  -   SQLAnywhere import
  -   Federated View
